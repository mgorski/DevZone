Installation:

    1. To install the downloaded module, go to Extensions tab and 
       choose “Install/Uninstall”.
    2. Now upload the module from your hard drive, and wait for 
       the successfull installation message.
    3. Next go to the Extension tab again and choose Module Manager.
    4. Find the new module on the list and click on GetResponse Integration.
    5. Now it’s time to edit the module settings. In the “WebForm ID” field, 
       paste the ID of the sign up form you created in GetResponse.  You’ll 
       find the ID in your web form’s HTML code.
    6. If you want your web form to look exactly like you created it in 
       GetResponse, leave the “Display Styles” set to “yes”. 
    7. After you’re done with editing the module, make sure to save your 
       settings.  Then from the module list choose “GetResponse Integration” 
       module again and click “Enable” at the top of the page.

    Done!
