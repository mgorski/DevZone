This method provides MESSAGE_IDs which can be used in other methods.

Array flags may be present and represent message flags which may contain following values:

clicktrack – clicks on links in message are counted.  Note that for the link to be clicktracked it must be also wrapped in Dynamic Content {{LINK}} tag. This behaves differently than WWW interface, where (for simplicity) all links are clicktracked when clicktrack checkbox is set.
subscription_reminder – short disclaimer is added to the message content to make sure that subscriber know why they are receiving the messages.
openrate – opened messages are counted (only if html content is present).
google_analytics – Google Analytics code is appended to every link in message,
Hint: All mergewords in subject are returned as GetResponse Dynamic Content syntax.

Hint: If type is follow-up then day_of_cycle is returned and if type is newsletter then send_on is returned. Those fields are not present in draft mode.

Hint: If you need plain and HTML contents of your message use get_message_contents method.

            }
        },
        "error" : null
    }
Hint: Stats are aggregated by dates of given events. Hence it is normal to have stats with sent = 0 and other values positive because opens, clicks, bounces and complaints take place also during a few days after message was sent.

send_newsletter
Queue a newsletter to be sent.

JSON Request:

    {
        "method" : "send_newsletter",
        "params" : [

                "get_contacts" : { get_contacts conditions },

                "get_suppressions" : { get_suppressions conditions }

            }
        ]
    }
Conditions:

campaign (mandatory) – CAMPAIGN_ID obtained from get_campaigns. Newsletter will be saved in this campaign. Note that it has nothing to do with selecting contacts – check contacts / get_contacts params for that.
from_field (optional) – FROM_FIELD_ID obtained from get_account_from_fields. It affects From header (name and email) in message. This value will be taken from campaign if not given.
subject (mandatory) – Subject value, all mergewords should be written as GetResponse Dynamic Content syntax.
contents (mandatory) – Allowed keys are plain and html, at least one is mandatory. All mergewords should be written as GetResponse Dynamic Content syntax.
flags (optional) – Enables extra functionality for a message, see message flags for available values.
contacts / get_contacts (at least one mandatory)- Contacts that should receive a newsletter. See IDs in conditions for detailed explanation.

            "MESSAGE_ID" : "abc123"
        },
        "error" : null
    }
Value of contacts represents the number of unique email addresses that are set to receive this newsletter.

or in case of failure

    {
        "result" : null,
        "error"  : "Missing campaign"
    }
Following errors may be returned: Missing campaign, Missing From field, Missing contents, Contacts list empty, Dynamic Content syntax error, Daily limit of newsletters exceeded.

Hint: You don’t have to worry about duplicates when sending to multiple campaigns.

    {
        "method" : "send_newsletter",
        "params" : [
            "your_api_key_here",
            {
                ...
                "get_contacts" : {
                    "get_campaigns" : {
                        "name" : { "CONTAINS" : "my_campaign_%" }
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
In this case if the same email exists in my_campaign_1 and my_campaign_2 campaigns then newsletter will be sent only once to this address (chosen randomly).

Warning: You can send 128 newsletters daily. Common mistake is to call API in the following manner:

    {
        "method" : "send_newsletter",
        "params" : [
            "your_api_key_here",
            {
                "subject" : "Hi John",
                ...
                "contacts" : [ "CONTACT_ID" ],
            }
        ]
    }
and again…

    {
        "method" : "send_newsletter",
        "params" : [
            "your_api_key_here",
            {
                "subject" : "Hi Jessica",
                ...
                "contacts" : [ "CONTACT_ID" ],
            }
        ]
    }
and again…

    {
        "method" : "send_newsletter",
        "params" : [
            "your_api_key_here",
            {
                "subject" : "Hi Bruce",
                ...
                "contacts" : [ "CONTACT_ID" ],
            }
        ]
    }
If you iterate through your contact list and personalize every call then you’re doing it wrong! It can be compared to sending a group of passengers from city A to B, but every passenger travels in his own train.

Correct way of sending personalized content is to use Dynamic Content syntax (check campaign_or_contact_info section) and send newsletter once to a group of people:

    {
        "method" : "send_newsletter",
        "params" : [
            "your_api_key_here",
            {
                "subject" : "Hi {{CONTACT \"subscriber_first_name\"}}",
                ...
                "contacts" : [ "CONTACT_ID", "CONTACT_ID", "CONTACT_ID" ],
            }
        ]
    }

Conditions:

campaigns / get_campaigns (optional) – Search only in given campaigns. Uses OR logic. If those params are not given, search is performed in all campaigns within the account. Check IDs in conditions for detailed explanation.
name (optional) – Use text operators to narrow down search results to specific contact names.
email (optional) – Use text operators to narrow down search results to specific contact emails.
created_on (optional) – Use time operators to narrow down search results to specific contact creation date. Multiple operators are allowed and logic AND is used so date range can also be expressed.
origin (optional) – Narrow down search results by contacts’ origin (subscription method). Allowed values are import, email, www, panel, leads, sale, api, forward, survey, iphone.
cycle_day (optional) – Use numeric operators to narrow down search results to specific  days of the followup cycles assigned to the contacts. To find contacts that already got day 2 message you have to use { "GREATER" : 2 } as they have already reached that day. To find inactive contacts pass { "EQUALS" : null } condition.
customs (optional) – Use text operators to narrow down search results to contacts having specific customs. Uses AND logic. Note that if you need OR logic you can use MATCHES operator and use alternative in regular expression. Contacts that don’t have a custom of given name are not returned in results. If custom is multivalue then “any” junction is used: condition is true if any custom value tests true according to the operator used.
geo (optional) – Use operators to narrow down search results to specific contact geo location. Text operators are allowed for country, country_code, city. Numeric operators are allowed for latitude and longitude (values are decimal numbers, like -54.5). Uses AND logic. Contacts that don’t have a geo location data are not returned in results.
clicks / get_clicks (optional) – Use to narrow down search results to the contacts that clicked specific links. Uses AND logic. See IDs in conditions for detailed explanation.
last_click_on (optional) – Use time operators to narrow down search results to a specific date when a contact clicked the last link. Multiple operators are allowed and logic AND is used so date range can also be expressed.
opens / get_opens (optional) – Use to narrow down search results to contacts that opened specific messages. Uses AND logic. See IDs in conditions for detailed explanation.
last_open_on (optional) – Use time operators to narrow down search results to the specific date when a contact opened the last message. Multiple operators are allowed and logic AND is used so date range can also be expressed.
segmentation (optional) – Allows to fetch big results in smaller packs. Split value defines the number of packs to which contacts will be split. Group defines which pack will be returned in results. For example to get all results in 10 packs call get_contacts 10 times. Set split to 10 and increase pack from 1 to 10.
JSON Response:

        },
        "error" : null
    }
Warning: Email is unique within a campaign, but if search is performed on multiple campaigns, one email address may occur multiple times in results.

Hint:  Segmentation does not work as pager (LIMIT x, OFFSET y behavior in SQL) and packs are “almost equal”. That means if you perform split = 10 on result that has 1000 contacts, you will get packs containing about 100 contacts.

But segmentation has two very important properties that LIMIT x, OFFSET y approach doesn’t have:

Contacts stay in their packs forever. Contact once found in the pack 23/100 will always be located in it no matter if the list was altered . This property can be used for shard-oriented synchronization.
Packs don’t overlap. The sum of contacts in packs 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 is the same as in search without segmentation. This property is important if you want to parallelize operation on contacts.
get_contact

or in case of failure

    {
        "result" : null,
        "error"  : "Missing contact"
    }
Following errors may be returned: Missing contact.

Hint:  One custom name may appear multiple times in case of multivalue customs (custom must be defined as multivalue on web interface). In this case new content will be added to existing custom instead of replacing previous one.

Hint: If you want to remove every existing content value for multivalue customs then pass null as content value at the beginning of method call:

"customs" : [
    {
        "name"       : "name_1_value",
        "content"    : null
    },
    {
        "name"       : "name_1_value",
        "content"    : "content_1_1_value"

    {
        "name"       : "name_1_value",
        "content"    : "content_1_2_value"
    },
]
This will clear all content values of multivalue custom and set two new ones.

Warning: Custom will be silently skipped if it’s multivalue and its content is not in set of allowed values declared on web interface.

Warning: Custom will be silently skipped if its content does not match type declared on web interface.

        "result" : null,
        "error" : "Missing contact"
    }
Following errors may be returned: Missing contact.

Warning: Do not confuse the day of cycle with position in cycle. For example if a follow-up cycle has messages set to days 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and you set cycle_day = 4 then a contact will get message from day 4 and not message from day 8 because it’s 4th in a row.

add_contact

If insert mode is chosen then a contact will be added if it doesn’t exist in a given campaign but no updates will be performed otherwise. If update is chosen then a contact will be updated if it exists in a given campaign but no inserts will be performed otherwise. Default is standard.
name (optional) – Name value.
email (mandatory) – Email value.
cycle_day (optional) – Insert contact on a given day at the follow-up cycle. Value of 0 means the beginning of the cycle. Lack of this param means that a contact will not be inserted into cycle.
ip (optional) – Contact’s IP address used for geo location. Must be given in dotted decimal format.
customs (optional) – List of contact customs. In case of contact update new customs will be inserted and the existing ones will be updated with the new values. Customs not provided on this list will not be removed. Custom name must be composed using lowercase letters, digits and underscores only.

Following errors may be returned: Invalid email syntax, Missing campaign, Contact already queued for target campaign.

Warning: Adding contact is not an instant action. It will appear on your list after validation or after validation+confirming (in case of double-optin procedure).

Hint: It’s legal to add a contact already existing in the campaign (check action param for more details) but it’s illegal to have the same email added to queue twice.

Hint: Optin setting is locked to double optin by default, if you want to add contacts already confirmed please contact us using this form and provide us with your campaign name and the description of your business model. We will set single optin for this campaign after short verification.

OPERATORS
There may be several types of operators in method conditions.

Text
EQUALS, NOT_EQUALS – Compare text literally. Case insensitive.
CONTAINS, NOT_CONTAINS – Compare text with wildchars. Use % for any string and ? for one character. Case insensitive.
MATCHES – Compare using regular expression. Syntax explained here.
Numeric
LESS, LESS_OR_EQUALS, EQUALS, GREATER_OR_EQUALS, GREATER – Compare numbers. Use . (dot) as decimal part separator if needed.
Time
FROM, TO, AT – Compare dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Warning: Operators must be UPPERCASED.

IDs IN CONDITIONS
In many methods IDs may be passed to conditions. Method get_messages will be used as an example of how to do it.

    {
        "method" : "get_messages",
        "params" : [
            "your_api_key_here",
            {
                "campaigns"     : [ "CAMPAIGN_ID", "CAMPAIGN_ID" ],
                "get_campaigns" : { get_campaigns conditions },
                ...
            }
        ]
    }
Method expects a list of campaigns in conditions to narrow down search results.

Those campaigns may be given as an array of CAMPAIGN_ID values obtained from get_campaigns.

    "campaigns" : [ "4b1b5", "b35f2b" ]
It will return messages from those two specific campaigns.

But sometimes it is faster/easier to nest get_campaigns conditions in get_messages method.

    "get_campaigns" : {
        "name" : { "CONTAINS" : "my_campaign_%" }
    }
It will return messages from campaigns that have name beginning with my_campaign_. Pretty easy, isn’t it?

Hint: In this case you can provide only campaigns condition or only get_campaigns condition or … both.

    {
        "method" : "get_messages",
        "params" : [
            "your_api_key_here",
            {
                "campaigns"     : [ "071ec79" ],
                "get_campaigns" : {
                    "name" : { "CONTAINS" : "%product%" }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
It will return messages from campaign having CAMPAIGN_ID = 071ec79 and from campaigns that have product word in name.

Hint: Nesting of conditions is also legal. For example send_newsletter conditions may contain get_contacts conditions which may contain get_links conditions which may contain get_messages conditions which may contain get_campaigns conditions. Everything in one request!

Warning: Do not use campaigns when you mean get_campaigns. And the other way round. Condition campaigns expects array of CAMPAIGN_ID values while condition get_campaigns expects get_campaigns method conditions. Same for messages/get_messages, contacts/get_contacts and others.

Warning: Do not provide text where ID is expected. This is incorrect.

    "campaigns" : [ "my_campaign_1" ]
